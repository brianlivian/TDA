Topological Data Analysis of Financial Time Series

Thesis for MA in Mathematics at Katz School of Science at Health, Yeshiva University

Topology is the theorical mathematical field of shape. Recently, TDA has been developed as an application of topology to data. By applying topology to data, we can quantify and understand the effects of the shape of data.

This project quantifies the topology of financial data. It implies that the shape of data is an indicator of stock market crashes.
